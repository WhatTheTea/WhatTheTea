# WhatTheTea🍵 - .NET Developer from 🇺🇦 Ukraine
Alex, .NET developer since 2018. I have experience with desktop and web development.
For my achievements in software design I was awarded by JASU and VNTU (in my late school and early college period).
In college I have seeked for a part-time job, which leaded me to experience in mentoring and teaching the basics of C#, C++, Python and Unity.
